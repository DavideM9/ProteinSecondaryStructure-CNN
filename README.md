## Introduction
Proteins are chains of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. Many conformations of this chains are possible due to the many possible combinations of amino acids and rotation of the chain in multiple positions along the chain. It is these conformational changes that are responsible for differences in the three dimensional structure of proteins.

Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry; it is highly important in medicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in the design of novel enzymes). [[1]](#references)

When we talk about the structure of proteins, four different structure levels are mentioned: the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure.

Protein primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein.

Protein secondary structure is the three dimensional form of local segments of proteins. Secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein folds into its three dimensional tertiary structure.
Both protein and nucleic acid secondary structures can be used to aid in [multiple sequence alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment).

The tertiary structure is however particularly interesting as it describes the 3D structure of the protein molecule, which reveals very important functional and chemical properties, such as which chemical bindings the protein can take part in.

Predicting protein tertiary structure from only its amino acid sequence is a very challenging problem, but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is becomes more tractable. [[2]](#references)

I focused on the primary and secondary structure (SS), more specifically on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting the secondary structure of proteins given their primary structure.

## Protein Structures and Protein Data
The primary structure of proteins are described by the sequence of amino acids on their polypeptide chain.
There are 20 natural occuring amino acids which, in a one letter notation, is denoted by: ’A’, ’C’, ’D’, ’E’, ’F’, ’G’, ’H’, ’I’, ’K’, ’L’, ’M’, ’N’, ’P’, ’Q’, ’R’, ’S’, ’T’, ’V’, ’W’, ’Y’. ’A’ standing for Alanine, ’C’ for Cysteine, ’D’ for Aspartic Acid etc. A 21st letter, ’X’, is sometimes used for denoting an unknown or any amino acid.

Instead of using the  primary stracture as a simple indicator for the presence of one of the aminoacids, **Protein Profiles** are used to take into account evolutionary neighborhoods and are used to model protein families and domains. They are built by converting multiple sequence alignments into position-specific scoring systems (PSSMs). Amino acids at each position in the alignment are scored according to the frequency with which they occur at that position. [[3]](#references)

A protein’s polypeptide chain typically consist of around 200-300 amino acids, but it can consist of far less or far more. The amino acids can occure at any position in a chain, meaning that even for a chain consisting of 4 amino acids, there are 204 possible distinct combinations. In the used [dataset](#the-dataset) the average protein chain cosists of 208 amino acids.

Proteins’ secondary structure determines structural states of local segments of amino acid residues in the protein. The alpha-helix state for instance forms a coiled up shape and the beta-strand forms a zig-zag like shape etc. The secondary structure of the protein is interesting because it, as mentioned in the introduction, reveals important chemical properties of the protein and because it can be used for further predicting it’s tertiary structure. When predicting protein's secondary structure we distinguish between **3-state SS** prediction and **8-state SS** prediction. 
For 3-state prediction the goal is to classify each amino acid into either:
- alpha-helix, which is a regular state denoted by an ’H’
- beta-strand, which is a regular state denoted by an ’E’
- coil region, which is an irregular state denoted by a ’C’
The letters which denotes the above secondary structures are not to be confused with those which denotes the amino acids.

For 8-state prediction, Alpha-helix is further sub-divided into three states: alpha-helix (’H’), 310 helix (’G’) and pi-helix (’I’). Beta-strand is sub-divided into: beta-strand (’E’) and beta-bride (’B’) and coil region is sub-divided into: high curvature loop (’S’), beta-turn (’T’) and irregular (’L’). [[2]](#references)

For the scope of this project the more challenging 8-state prediction problem has been chosen.
